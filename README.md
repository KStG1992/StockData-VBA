### VBA-challenge

### Description
This folder contains 6 files, as listed below. I have written a Macro that will loop through each worksheet of either workbook, Test Data and Stock Data, output the name of the ticker, the yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume. 

### Files
*[Test Data] (alphabetical_testing_KSG.xlsm) - This file was used while I developed my script.

*[Stock Data] (Multiple_year_stock_data_KSG.xlsm) - This file was used to run my script and generate the final homework report.

*[VBA Macro] (vba_code_KSG.vb) - This Visual Basic file holds the script for both Test Data and Stock Data.

*[PDF Files] (2014_stock_data_KSG.pdf)(2015_stock_data_KSG.pdf)(2016_stock_data_KSG.pdf) - These files are PDFs of each year with the results of the Multi Stock Data.
